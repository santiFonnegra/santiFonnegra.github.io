**You will submit this homework assignment as as HTML file on Canvas. PDF or .Rmd submissions receives zero. **

*For all questions, include the R commands/functions that you used to find your answer (show R chunk). Answers without supporting code will not receive credit. Write full sentences to describe your findings.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 1:

The dataset `mtcars` was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and other aspects of automobile design and performance for different cars (1973-74 models). Look up the documentation for this data frame with a description of the variables by typing `?mtcars` **in the console** pane.

### Question 1: (2 pt)

Take a look at the first 6 rows of the dataset by using an `R` function in the code chunk below. Have you heard about any (or all) of these cars?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
mtcars
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
I haven't, I've only heard of the hornet
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 2: (2 pts)

How many rows and columns are there in this data frame in total?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
dim(mtcars)
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
using dim(mtcars) we get 32 and 11 rows 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 3: (1 pt)

Save `mtcars` in your environment and name it as your `eid`. From now on, use this new object instead of the built-in dataset.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
sf27787<- mtcars
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
done!, added the data set
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 4: (2 pts)

When is your birthday? Using indexing, grab the row of `mpg` that corresponds to the day of your birthday (should be a number between 1 and 31).

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
birthday_mpg <- sf27787$mpg[8]
birthday_mpg
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
done, I grabbed my birthdya from the mpg row. which ended up being associated with 24.4.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 5: (2 pts)

Using logical indexing, count the number of rows in the dataset where the variable `mpg` takes on values greater than 30.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
sum(sf27787$mpg > 30)

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
so after taking the function sum() function, taking my car data into my UT ID, after indexing that from the data? we got the result of 4 cars that are greatere than 30. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 6: (2 pts)

Let's create a new variable called `kpl` which converts the fuel efficiency `mpg` in kilometers per liter. Knowing that 1 mpg corresponds to 0.425 kpl, complete the following code and calculate the max kpl:

```{r}
# Add a new variable to the dataset
# lg28373$kpl <- lg28373$mpg
sf27787$kpl <- sf27787$mpg * 0.425
max_kpl <- max(sf27787$kpl)
sf27787$kpl <- sf27787$mpg * 0.425
max_kpl <- max(sf27787$kpl)

max_kpl
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
so taking the max gallons per mile converted into liters per mile.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2:

Let's quickly explore another built-in dataset: `airquality` which contains information about daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973. 

### Question 7: (2 pts)

Calculate the mean `Ozone` (in ppb) using the `mean()` function. Why does it make sense to get this answer? *Hint: take a look at the column `Ozone` in the dataset.*

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
airquality

mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm =TRUE)
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
so after using the mean function we get a result of 42.12931, this makes sense since we were missing a lot of values and had outliers still be part of the calculation. But using teh na.rm command we  removed the no values. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 8: (2 pts)

Look at the documentation for the function `mean()` by running `?mean` **in the console**. What argument should be used to find the mean value that we were not able to get in the previous question? What type of values does that argument take?

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
We should use trim, this will get rid of whatever lenght of data we dont need. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 9: (2 pts)

Sometimes the R documentation does not feel complete. We wish we had more information or more examples. Find a post online (include the link) that can help you use that argument in the `mean()` function. Then finally find the mean ozone!

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
trimmed_mean <- mean(airquality$Ozone, trim = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE)
trimmed_mean
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
https://www.statology.org/str_trim-in-r/,
this helped me understand what the trim function accomplishes. 
we can see with the trim that the mean is now lower since we took away .10 of the data.
