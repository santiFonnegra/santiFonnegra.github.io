**You will submit this homework assignment as as HTML file on Canvas. PDF or .Rmd submissions receive zero.**

*For all questions, include the R commands/functions that you used to find your answer (show R chunk). Answers without supporting code will not receive credit. Write full sentences to describe your findings.*

**The goal of this assignment is to encode your name (or any other message) using a *cipher* function: We want to replace each letter of a given character vector with the letter of the alphabet that is *k* positions after it in the alphabet. For example, if the letter was `a` and `k = 3`, we would replace it with `d`. We will also want it to loop around, so if the letter was `y` and `k = 3`, we'd replace it with `b`. For example, with `k = 3`, the word `dog` would become `grj`. Let's take it step by step.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 1: (2 pts)

Type the word `letters` into the R chunk below. What does this predefined object in R contain? What is this object's data type/class? How many elements does it contain? *Include base R commands used to answer all three questions.*

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
letters
class(letters)

length(letters)
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
"a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t"
[21] "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"

[1] "character"

[1]26
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 2: (2 pts)

First, here is the code to split a word into a vector containing each letter.

```{r}
test <- unlist(strsplit("test", split = ""))
# Note: the function strsplit() returns a list, use unlist() to return a vector
```

Remember that `A %in% B` returns a vector of the positions of matches of an object A in an object B (Worksheet 2):

```{r}
letters %in% test
```

How many elements are false in the resulting logical vector? *Include base R commands used to answer this question (recall: TRUE is equivalent to the value 1 and FALSE is 0.*

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
logical_vector <- letters %in% test
sum(!logical_vector)
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
Out of the 26 letters in the alphabet, 22 are not present in the word 'test'.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 3: (2 pts)

Another function that will be useful is `which()`: it takes a logical vector as an input and returns the indices/positions that are TRUE. For example, run the following code:

```{r}
# Note: T is shorthand for TRUE, F for FALSE
which(c(F,T,F,T,F,T))
```

The output tells you that elements in position 2, 4, and 6 are true. Now, use the `which` function, along with `%in%` and `letters`, to find which positions in the alphabet the letters in the name `arya` occupy (saved as an object called `name_v` below). Would that combination of functions alone work to encode a name? Why/Why not?

```{r}
# Define name as a vector
name_v <- unlist(strsplit("arya", split = ""))

# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
Position_arya <- which(letters %in% name_v)
Position_arya
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
the positon comes out to 1, 18, 25. But I dont know how to make it account for repeted letters. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 4: (2 pts)

How can we avoid this? For example, we can test each letter one at a time in their correct order! One approach would be to use a *for loop*. Write a for loop that goes through each element of the character vector `name_v` (i.e., each letter in `c("a","r","y","a")`) one at a time, finds its position in the alphabet, and saves each position in a vector called `positions`. Confirm that the positions are correct by using `positions` as an index to find the corresponding letters in the object `letters`.

*For example, the name `ali` would give you the positions 1,12, and 9. You can grab the letters in those positions by doing* `letters[c(1, 12, 9)]`.

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
positions <- c()
for (letter in name_v){
  positions <- c(positions, which( letters == letter))
  
}

letters[positions]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 5: (2 pts)

Let's encode the name `arya`! Shift all the `positions` by 1 and index `letters` to obtain the encoded name. Is the encoded name a real name?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
# Shifting the positions by 1
encoded_positions <- positions + 1

# Indexing 'letters' to obtain the encoded name
encoded_name <- letters[encoded_positions]
encoded_name

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
It doesn't seem so since the code shifted it by 1, I dont see the namme, so no real name?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 6: (2 pts)

Now, what if you would like to get the positions in your name? Or any other name? We would have to repeat questions 2-5... Instead let's write a function to 1) split a name as a vector (i.e., a character vector whose elements contain single letters), 2) initialize the positions, and 3) report each position in a vector `positions` with a for loop for each new name we would like to encode. The function should take a `name` (for example, "arya") as the input and return the alphabetical positions each of those letters occupy. Call the function `get_position`. Once you have defined it, test it out with "arya". Did you get all positions?

```{r}
# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)
get_position <- function(name) {
  name_v <- unlist(strsplit(name, split = ""))
  positions <- c()
  for (letter in name_v) {
    positions <- c(positions, which(letters == letter))
  }
  return(positions)
}

# Testing the function with 'arya'
get_position("arya")

```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
the function get; got me the postions of the letters in the name arya again as 1,18, 25 and 1. So it seems so!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 7: (2 pts)

What happens when we shift the positions past `z`, the 26th and final letter of the alphabet? Shifting the positions in `arya` up by `k = 2` should give `ctac`, but since there is no 27th element of letters, it will return `NA` instead of `a`. Try it in the code chunk below.

```{r}
letters[get_position(name_v) + 2]
# returns NA instead of a :(

shifted_positions <- (get_position(name_v) + 2) %% 26
corrected_positions <- ifelse(shifted_positions == 0, 26, shifted_positions)
encoded_name <- letters[corrected_positions]
encoded_name

```

How do we make it loop around so that `z` shifted up 1 becomes `a`? In other words, how can we make 27 become 1, 28 become 2, 29 becomes 3, etc.? We will use a mathematical operator called modulo `%%` (which tells you the remainder when you divide one number by another). Try running the code below, `27 %% 26` (pronounced "27 modulo 26"). It returns 1, the remainder when the number on the left (27) is divided by the number on the right (26).

```{r}
27 %% 26
```

We just need our shifted positions *modulo* 26. You can do this with `(positions + k) %% 26`. One last minor issue: `26 %% 26` is 0 (or any multiple of 26 %% 26 is 0) but we want it to return 26 (i.e., the letter `z`). We can fix this issue by using `ifelse` for example. Test if `positions + k %% 26` is 0: if it is, use 26, if it is not use `positions + k %% 26`. Use your function `get_position()` and the fix with modulo `%%` in `ifelse()` to encode the word `arya` by shifting every letter `k = 2` positions forward correctly. Is the encoded name a real name?

# your code goes below (make sure to edit comment)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 8: (2 pts)

Putting it all together: Write a function that incorporates all the work you have done to achieve the encoding task. Name the function `cipher`. This function should take two arguments: a `name` (a string) and how many positions to shift (`k`). Fill in the code below with what you have been using above. Check your code with `arya` shifted by 2 positions and test your code with your own name with the shift of your choice! Is the encoded name a real name?

```{r}
# edit the code below (make sure to edit comment)
cipher <- function(name, k) {
  
  name_v <- unlist(strsplit(name, split = ""))
  
  positions <- c()
  for (letter in name_v) {
    pos <- which(letters == letter)
    shifted_pos <- (pos + k) %% 26
    shifted_pos <- ifelse(shifted_pos == 0, 26, shifted_pos)
    positions <- c(positions, shifted_pos)
  }
  
  encoded_name <- letters[positions]
  return(paste(encoded_name, collapse = ""))
}

# check
cipher("arya", 2)


# test with your name!
cipher <- function(name, k) {
  positions <- get_position(name)
  shifted_positions <- (positions + k) %% 26
  corrected_positions <- ifelse(shifted_positions == 0, 26, shifted_positions)
  encoded_name <- letters[corrected_positions]
  return(encoded_name)
}

# Checking the function with 'arya' shifted by 2 positions
cipher("arya", 2)

# Testing the function with another name (e.g., "sam") shifted by 3 positions
cipher("sam", 3)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Question 9: (2 pts)

A less guided question... You were given the code `oldp`. Can you decipher the code and find the name hidden behind it?

```{r}

deciphered_name_1 <- cipher("oldp", -1)

deciphered_name_2 <- cipher("oldp", -2)

deciphered_name_1
deciphered_name_2
```

**Your answer goes here. Write sentences in bold.**
